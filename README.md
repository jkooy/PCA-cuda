# PCA based face recognition using custom CUDA kernel

This CUDA codebase performs face recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

1. Configure and generate solution using CMake.
2. Run the generated solution ```ece277finalproject``` using Visual Studio.
3. Set ```pca``` or ```pca_cpu``` as the Startup Project, build solution.
5. Run the program.

Work completed in partial fulfillment of course requirements for ECE 277, GPU Programming during Winter 2021 at UCSD by Aparna Srinivasan and Xuehai He.
